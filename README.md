Project Walkthrough

1. Problem Addressed: Traditional online auction systems often rely on centralized intermediaries, potentially leading to issues with fees, transparency, and limited accessibility. This project aims to provide a decentralized alternative powered by Fuel OS.

2. Project Features

    Trustless Auction Logic: Core auction mechanics (bidding, determining winners, settlement) are governed by auditable Sway smart contracts.
    User-Friendly Interface: A simple web frontend allows users to browse available auctions, place bids, and track their auction activity.
    Customizable Auction Parameters: Auction creators can set starting prices, durations, and potentially choose different auction formats.

3. Technology Stack

    Fuel OS: The blockchain foundation, providing low-cost, parallel transaction execution with the UTXO model.
    Sway: The contract-oriented language used to write the auction smart contracts.
    Forc: Sway compiler.
    Fuelup: Tooling for contract deployment and interaction with the Fuel chain.
    [Frontend Choice]: A JavaScript framework (React, Vue.js, or similar) for the bidding interface.
